## Reporting Issues

We use GitHub Issues as the official bug tracker for Trerry. Here are some advices for our users that want to report an issue:

1. Make sure that you are using the latest version of Trerry. Check for your fork's master branch status and see if it's up to date with the upstream/master (our repository)
2. Provide us with reproducible steps for the issue.
3. Some issues may be platform specific, so specifying what platform and if it's a simulator or a hardware device will help a lot.
